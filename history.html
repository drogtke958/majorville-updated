            locust trees and an apple orchard around the cabin. Most of the forest in this area was hardwood, but there were some stands of white 
            pine inland from Pine Lake. By the late 1850s, lumber speculators were on their way north as the forests near Grand Haven and Muskegon 
            were harvested.</p>

        <p>Dr. Arthur Oâ€™Leary, recognized the financial potential of the timber stands around Pine Creek. A sawmill was built on the south side of 
        Pine Creek not far from Lake Michigan. Mill operation began in 1869 for the purpose of producing white pine lumber, and the town of 
        Majorville was established.</p>
